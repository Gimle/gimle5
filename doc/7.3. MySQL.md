MySQL
=====

A simple extension the the built in ```mysqli``` class is provided. This extension will create a singleton with all connected databases in one object for easy reuse across files.

The extension provides datatype support for results with the ```get_assoc()``` method and a ```explain()``` method to explain all the queries that was performed.

To set up a new connection you can specify connection information in config.php or config.ini.

### Example config.php ###
```php
<?php
$config['mysql']['myconnection'] = [];
$config['mysql']['myconnection']['host'] = 'localhost';
$config['mysql']['myconnection']['user'] = 'username';
$config['mysql']['myconnection']['pass'] = 'password';
```

### Example config.ini ###
```ini
[mysql.myconnection]
host = "localhost"
user = "username"
pass = "password"
```

### Getting a mysql object ###

To retrieve the mysql object for this connection use:

```php
<?php
$myconnection = Mysql::getInstance('myconnection');
```

### Results with datatype ###
```php
<?php
$query = "SELECT `col` FROM `table`;";
$result = $myconnection->query($query);
while ($row = $result->get_assoc()) {
	d($row);
}
```

### Showing query explanations ###
```php
<?php
echo $myconnection->explain();
```
