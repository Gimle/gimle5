Variable dumping
================

In addition to the native variable dumping methods found in php Gimle provides it's own little collection.

These are all wrappers to the same base function and located in the gimle namespace. It is easy to new wrappers for other namespaces.

The main purpose of these dump functions are to provide a slick, easy to read dump for development and debugging. The code is not optimized for high load production servers.

The most used wrapper for web development dumping is simply called ```d($var)```.

### Example 1:
> ```php
> <?php
> $var = 'Hello';
> d($var);
> ```
> Output:
> ```html
> d($var) = String(5) 'Hello'
> ```

### Example 2:
> ```php
> <?php
> $var = ['Hello', 'World'];
> d($var);
> ```
> Output:
> ```html
> d($var) => Array (2)
> (
> |   ['0'] = String(5) 'Hello'
> |   ['1'] = String(5) 'World'
> )
> ```

### Example 3:
> ```php
> <?php
> $var = new \StdClass();
> $var->prop = 'Hello';
> d($var);
> ```
> Output:
> ```html
> d($var) => stdClass Object
> (
> |   ['prop' magic] = String(5) 'Hello'
> )
> ```

The ```d($var)``` function will automatically detect if you are in web or cli mode. To override the detection you can use the dedicated functions ```web_dump($var)``` or ```cli_dump($var)```.

For more about dumping see the inline source documentation of the [dump.php](../autoload/dump.php) file.
