Data Transfer
=============

```php
<?php
$fetch = new Fetch(); // Will use curl wrapper if available, otherwise will use stream.

$fetch->connectionTimeout($float); // Sets the connection timeout.
$fetch->resultTimeout($float); // Sets the result timeout.

$fetch->post($key, $data); // Adds a post field to the request.

$fetch->file($key, $data, $name); // Adds a file to the request.

$fetch->header($key, $value); // Adds a custom header to the request.

$fetch->reset(); // Reset all fields and headers that are set.
$fetch->reset(true); // Reset the whole fetch object, including request timeouts.

$fetch->query($endpoint); // Queries the endpoint.

$fetch->head($endpoint); // Send a head request to the endpoint.

```

```php
<?php
// Depends on the DiskOI class.
// All configuration of the FetchCache follows the Fetch class setup.

$fetchCache = new FetchCache(); // Will use curl wrapper if available, otherwise will use stream.

$fetchCache->expect($type); // Sets the expected content type. If there is a problem with the apt, and the endpoint serve a different content type than what is expected, the old cache is returned along with a error message describing why the cache could not be updated.

$fetchCache->expire($search); // Some xml apis have a field in the xml describing how long the results are cached on the server. If you provide the xpath to where to search for this information here, the cache will auto update only when the server have updated information available.

$fetchCache->folder($folder); // The cache is stored in this folder underneath the default cache folder.

$fetchCache->query($endpoint); // Queries the endpoint if the cache is older than 600 seconds. If not returns the cached response.
$fetchCache->query($endpoint, $ttl); // Sets a different timeout value. If $ttl = integer, it will be read as seconds. If $ttl = false, the cache will be kept forever. If $ttl = null, the system will always try to renew, and only deliver back a cached result if the server was not able to provide an accepted response.
$fetchCache->query($endpoint, $ttl, $validationCallback); // Also require the response to pass the callback method to be able to be cached. This can be useful if you need to validate the content before accepting it. If the callback returns anything but a boolean value, that value is stored in the cache instead of what was originally returned. This can be useful when you need to pre process the value returned before using it. You can do this only one, and not on every time it is used.
